Hi! This is my personal website. I created it to showcase my programming projects, which you can find on the [Projects](/projects) page and my [GitHub](https://github.com/Epsylene). I am interested mainly in 3D graphics, high-performance computing, CPU/GPU architecture and low-level programming. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me at <epsylene@gmail.com>.
